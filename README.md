Korean Dictionary for iOS

> [!NOTE]
> This dictionary currently only works for Korean -> English. 

This app was originally a small project out of frustration for the lack of good free Korean-English dictionaries on the App Store. 

During my time in the Apple Developer Academy, I was tasked with taking an existing app or website and redesigning it. I decided to take on this challenge and redesigned an existing app that I thought was poorly designed. 

I added features such as: 
- Exact matches and similar matches
- Favourites

As it was a redesign of an existing app, there are buttons for features that don't exist in this app, but did in that one. Therefore I intend on redesigning it again to just focus on the primary features, and add English->Korean search functionality and notes.
