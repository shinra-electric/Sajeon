Korean Dictionary for iOS

> [!NOTE]
> This dictionary currently only works for Korean -> English. 

This app was originally a small project borne out of frustration for the lack of good free Korean-English dictionaries on the App Store. 

During my time in the Apple Developer Academy, I was tasked with taking an existing app or website and redesigning it. I decided to take on this challenge and redesigned an existing app that I thought was poorly designed. 

I added features such as: 

- Exact matches and similar matches
- Favourites

Before I can post it to the App Store, I intend on redesigning it again with these points in mind: 

- Change the UI to focus on the primary features
- Add persistance
- Add English -> Korean search functionality
- Add notes
